# Warframe Market utility
This app makes it easier for you to manage your listings on the [Warframe Market](https://warframe.market), by providing you with:
  
* Easy access to the cheapest listings of a certain item on the market;
* Recommended listing prices based on others' listings;
* Warnings every 5 minutes when others' sale prices lower and recommended prices for your listings based on that change

All the information this utility uses come from the warframe market website.

## Progress
This project is a work-in-progress which I started to teach myself how to use java.util.regex and at the same time make a useful tool.
